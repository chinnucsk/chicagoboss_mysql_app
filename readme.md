Chicago Boss MySQL App
======================

This is a sample [Chicago Boss](http://chicagoboss.org) application with functional connection to [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) as a back-end database.

The Chicago Boss MySQL App is meant to work as a standalone starter app for hacking and learning. It is _NOT_ production ready.

The Chicago Boss MySQL App also ships with a pre-configured public Amazon Machine Image that you can launch on AWS, called theMob.
